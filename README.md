Ever wanted to blow off some steam. Hated using an OS or just want to destroy a virtual machine. then your in luck
QEMU-corrupter is a fork of qemu that randomly corrupts memory over time. You increase the intensity in the MACHINE tab . A build folder with all the precompiled files is there to.
currently it only supports i386. If you beg hard enough in the issues tab then I might support more


# Wait why is there a build folder with the precompiled files
well I figured if your downloading the source code. there wouldnt be any downsides with also having the precompiled versions as well. its barely like 10mb in size
so technically its a positive. your getting 2 in 1

# can I contribute
ill accept anything no matter the quailty. I have no idea how qemu source code works but I did my best. 

# does it work
No... well kinda I havent tested that much but it printed to the console that it set the corruption value. so I guess

# is this dangerous for my disk images should I use a backup
probally

# could this damage my pc?
I dont fucking know. most likely not

# WHERES THE COMPILED VERSION YOU ASSHOLE. I DONT WANT TO SPEND 16 HOURS COMPILING THIS MYSELF JUST GIVE ME THE EXECUTATEABLE
its in ./qemu/build/qemu-system-i386. 

# theres alot of security vurabilitys in this code
yes.

# how can I compile this myself
the same way youd compile qemu normally. theres nothing different or no extra steps. Wanted this to be as simple as possiable

# why does this readme suck. theres no 1 billon emojis and pictures just like evey other github readme post
add it yourself. Im tired
