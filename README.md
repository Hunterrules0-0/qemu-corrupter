# qemu-corrupter


Ever wanted to blow off some steam. Hated using an OS or just want to destroy a virtual machine. then your in luck
QEMU-corrupter is a fork of qemu that randomly corrupts memory over time. You increase the intensity in the MACHINE tab . A build folder with all the precompiled files is there to.
currently it only supports i386. If you beg hard enough in the issues tab then I might support more


#Wait why is there a build folder with the precompiled files
well I figured if your downloading the source code. there wouldnt be any downsides with also having the precompiled versions as well. its barely like 10mb in size
so technically its a positive. your getting 2 in 1

#can I contribute
ill accept anything no matter the quailty. I have no idea how qemu source code works but I did my best. 

#does it work
No... well kinda I havent tested that much

#is this dangerous for my disk images should I use a backup
probally

#could this damage my pc?
I dont fucking know. most likely not

#WHERES THE COMPILED VERSION YOU ASSHOLE. I DONT WANT TO SPEND 16 HOURS COMPILING THIS MYSELF JUST GIVE ME THE EXECUTATEABLE
its in ./qemu/build/qemu-system-i386. 


#how can I compile this myself
the same way youd compile qemu normally. theres nothing different or no extra steps. Wanted this to be as simple as possiable
